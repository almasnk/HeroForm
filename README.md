# Changes to be made

- // The preview page needs to be functional. Differences from the published version:
  - // No results will be submitted
  - // There will be a banner that says - viewing in preview mode.
- // Welcome screen and "success" / "thank you" screens for output
- // Output's progressbar needs to behave a bit more intuitively
- Add analytics to keep track of user visits and stuff :)
- Responsiveness:
  - // Make the LP responsive
  - // Make the dashboard responsive
  - // Make the output and editor pages responsive
  - Make the continue page responsive
- // Design the multiple choice for the editor
- Design the multiple choice for the output
- Make the "other option" and "multi select" functional for multiple choice
- // Fix all build + type errors and make it live on Vercel
- Test + QA on different devices + with different accounts
- Full page spinner not amazing
- Required fields is required
