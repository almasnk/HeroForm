# Changes to be made

- Add analytics to keep track of user visits and stuff :)
- Editor needs to show the viewport message a lot earlier
- Updating questions should also update the google sheets Questions tab
- We're storing the Id of thq question in the DB, but we need to store the option itself (in responses)
- Why is prisma running 10 instances (is it going to be prob in prod as well?)
- Deleting questions should be reflected in the sheets
- Order of the questions is not getting updated based on the actual order
- success page + welcome page copy needs to be good
