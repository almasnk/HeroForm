# Changes to be made

- The preview page needs to be functional. Differences from the published version:
  - No results will be submitted
  - There will be a banner that says - viewing in preview mode.
- Welcome screen and "success" / "thank you" screens for output
- Output's progressbar needs to behave a bit more intuitively
- Onboarding screen for dashboard
- Add analytics to keep track of user visits and stuff :)
- Responsiveness:
  - Make the LP responsive
  - Make the dashboard responsive
  - Make the output, preview and editor pages responsive
- Design the multiple choice for both the editor and the output
- Make the "other option" and "multi select" functional for multiple choice
- Bring back Typescript, fix all build + type errors and make it live on Vercel
- Test + QA on different devices + with different accounts
