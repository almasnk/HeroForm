1. Preview needs to be working:
   - same as published, few differences:
     1. No results will be submitted
     2. There will be a banner that says - viewing in preview mode.
2. // The max characters need to be enforced in the output
3. There should be a beginning screen, and a thank you screen (non editable for now) for the output
4. The output's progress bar needs to be have like typeform's as much as possible
5. In the dashboard, the onboarding screen needs to be functioning when there's no forms

No welcome or thank you screen in teh editor, just in the outputs.
